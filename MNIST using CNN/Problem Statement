PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that you have images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 
written by various people in boxes of a specific size - similar to the application forms in banks and universities.
The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

OBJECTIVE:
You are required to develop a model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. 

DATA DESCRIPTION:
For this problem, we use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and the actual number 
between 0-9 is the label. 
Since each image is of 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel forms a feature, there are 784 features. 

In this assignment, try experimenting with various hyperparameters in CNN and observe the highest accuracy you can get.

Important Note:
Since the training dataset is quite large (60,000 labelled images), it would take a lot of time for training a CNN on the full MNIST data, so you can sub-sample the data for 
training.

I have tried to first build a simple CNN model and then increased the complexity. Comparisions of all three models on the basis of metrics like accuracy and loss is done.
The testing is done on the 10,000 test images in the dataset.

Dataset: MNIST dataset. You can use the following command: from keras.datasets import mnist
